Dyndns would have given me the public IP, so I looked for a website to which the Pi could post data  (its ifconfig output) repeatedly, where I could easily access it from another pc.\nSince I couldn't find one and the APIs from all the paste* websites were way too complex for this, I created postAr.\nNow you and me can easily accomplish this task via:\n\n\twhile true; do\n\t\tifconfig | curl --data-binary @- http://post.paukl.at/post/pi-ip ; sleep 60;\n\tdone\n\n... and always know its IP by looking at /get/pi-ip\n","sticky":true,"time":1421045947660},"92u_z":{"key":"92u_z","value":"new post content :)","sticky":false,"time":1421045825056}}
